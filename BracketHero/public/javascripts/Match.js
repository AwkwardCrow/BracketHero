//players (1-4)
//state (finished or unfinished)
//game count (will reference players?)
//result (winner(s) and loser(s))
//position (used to calculate which players should enter a match for single/double)
//match doesn't have to have both players to be initialized.
//if a match finishes a new one can start for both winner and loser and can be fed by "neighboring" match result
//feels like a good example for a hash map or something similar
